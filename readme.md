Deserted Office is a clicker game with an old flash game aesthetic. You are an office worker that must complete surveys sent by email to earn enough money to buy food and fuel on the desert island you find yourself on. The only problem is will it be enough, balance your income with the coinflip mini game to survive in your deserted Office!
